    <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Probabilistic Models of Language (ProbModels) is a weekly meeting of staff and students interested in probabilistic and statistical methods as used in both natural language processing systems and models of human language acquisition and processing.  We schedule a mix of informal paper discussions and more formal research presentations, as well as conference practice talks and other research-related activities.</p>
<p>The primary faculty advisors for the group are <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sgwater/">Sharon Goldwater</a>,
<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/keller/">Frank Keller</a>, <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/">Mirella Lapata</a>, and <a href="http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~steedman/">Mark Steedman</a>.  We strongly
encourage all of our students and postdocs to attend, and welcome
other interested parties as well.  Meetings are normally held Tuesdays
from 12:30-1:30 in IF 4.31 (feel free to bring lunch).  You can
receive announcements with each week's topic or paper to read by
subscribing to our <a href="http://lists.inf.ed.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/statsnlp">mailing list</a>; we also try to keep the
<a href="http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/probmodels/schedule">schedule</a> on this page up-to-date.</p>
